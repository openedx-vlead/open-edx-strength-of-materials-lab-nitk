This method is based on simple geometric consideration and does not require the use of specialized formulas. While it was originally designed for graphical solutions, it lends itself well to the use of a calculator.<br /><br /> Consider a square element of a material subjected to plane stress (figure.1.) and let <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/Mohr%27s%20circle/sARpMyGs.png" style="width: 26px; height: 36px; position: relative; bottom: -15px;" />,<img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/Mohr%27s%20circle/FaOoGA2r.png" style="width: 26px; height: 36px; position: relative; bottom: -15px;" />, and <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/Mohr%27s%20circle/JsnrLTH4.png" style="width: 33px; height: 36px; position: relative; bottom: -15px;" /> be the component of stress exerted on the element. We plot a point X of coordinates x and -xy, and a point Y of coordinates <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/Mohr%27s%20circle/FaOoGA2r.png" style="width: 26px; height: 36px; position: relative; bottom: -15px;" /> and +<img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/Mohr%27s%20circle/JsnrLTH4.png" style="width: 33px; height: 36px; position: relative; bottom: -15px;" /> . If <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/Mohr%27s%20circle/JsnrLTH4.png" style="width: 33px; height: 36px; position: relative; bottom: -15px;" /> is positive, as assumed in (figure.1.), point X is located below the <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn.gif" style="width: 16px; height: 16px; position: relative;" /> axis and point Y above, as shown in (Figure.2.). If <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/Mohr%27s%20circle/JsnrLTH4.png" style="width: 33px; height: 36px; position: relative; bottom: -15px;" /> is negative, X is located above the <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn.gif" style="width: 16px; height: 16px; position: relative;" /> axis and Y below. Joining X and Y by a straight line, we define the point C of intersection of line XY with the <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn.gif" style="width: 16px; height: 16px; position: relative;" /> axis and draw the circle of the centre C and the diameter XY. Noting that the abscissa of C and radius of the circle are respectively equal to the quantities <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn.gif" style="width: 16px; height: 16px; position: relative;" /><sub>ave</sub> and R defined by equation <br /><br /> <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/Mohr%27s%20circle/eqn%201.jpg" style="width: 148px; height: 65px; position: relative; bottom: -15px;" /> and <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/Mohr%27s%20circle/eqn%202.jpg" style="width: 228px; height: 86px; position: relative; bottom: -15px;" /> <br /> <br /> We conclude that the circle obtained is Mohr&rsquo;s circle for plane stress. Thus the abscissa of points A and B where the circles intersect the <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn.gif" style="width: 16px; height: 16px; position: relative;" /> axis represent respectively the principal stresses <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn.gif" style="width: 16px; height: 16px; position: relative;" /><sub>max</sub> and <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn.gif" style="width: 16px; height: 16px; position: relative;" /><sub>min</sub> at the point considered. <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/mc1.gif" style="width: 457px; height: 499px;" /><br /> We also note that, since <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/Mohr%27s%20circle/ty37Xh1z.png" style="width: 177px; height: 59px; position: relative; bottom: -15px;" /> (the angle XCA is eqal in magnitude to one of the angles 2 that satisfies equation<br /> <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/Mohr%27s%20circle/eqn%203.jpg" style="width: 188px; height: 66px; position: relative; bottom: -15px;" /><br /> <br /> Thus, the angle that defines in (figure.1.) the orientation of principle plane corresponds to point A in (figure.2.) can be obtained by dividing in half the angle XCA measured on Mohr&rsquo;s Circle. We further observe that if &gt; and &gt; 0, as in the case considered here, the rotation which brings CX into CA is counterclockwise. But, in that case, the angle p obtained from equation<br /> <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/Mohr%27s%20circle/eqn%204.jpg" style="width: 188px; height: 66px; position: relative; bottom: -15px;" /><br /><br /> And defining the direction of the normal Oa to the principal plane is positive; thus the rotation bringing Ox into Oa is also counter clockwise . we conclude that the senses of rotation in both parts of (figure.1 and 2.) are the same; if a counterclockwise rotation through 2 p is required to bring CX into CA on Mohr&rsquo;s circle, a counterclockwise rotation through p will bring Ox into Oa in (figure1.).<br /><br /> The construction of Mohr&rsquo;s circle is greatly simplified if we consider separately each faces of the element used to define the stress components. From (figure.3 and figure.4) its observed that, when the shear stress extend on a given face tends to rotate the element clockwise, the point on Mohr&rsquo;s circle corresponding to that face is located above the S axis. When the shearing stress on a given face tends to rotate the element counterclockwise, the point corresponds to that face tends to rotate the element counterclockwise, the point corresponding to that face is located below the S axis. As far as normal stresses are concerned, the usual convention holds, i.e., a tensile stress is considered as positive and is plotted to the right, while a compressive stress is considered as negative and is plotted to the left. <img src="http://sm-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/mc3.gif" style="width: 764px; height: 250px;" /></p>
